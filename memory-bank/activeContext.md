# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Successfully deployed the Quran Data API as a standalone project on Vercel.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `package.json` for standalone project and added missing dependencies.
- Updated `vercel.json` with `version: 2` and removed explicit functions block.
- Updated `api/tsconfig.json` and created root `tsconfig.json` for correct TypeScript compilation.
- Created `public/index.html` for Vercel's public directory requirement and API documentation.
- Updated `.vercelignore` for correct Prisma client handling.
- Fixed `api/lib/prisma.ts` for correct Prisma client import path.
- Updated `api/v1/get-surah-description.ts` to use existing `QuranSurah` model.
- Updated `api/v1/get-metadata.ts` to handle missing `type` query parameter with a default response.

## Next Steps
- Continue to monitor deployment and API performance.
- Explore further enhancements as needed.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project is now a standalone API, not a monorepo.
- Vercel's automatic API route detection is being utilized.

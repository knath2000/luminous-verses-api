# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Successfully deployed and tested the Quran Data API as a standalone project on Vercel. All API endpoints including the new comprehensive transliteration endpoint are now fully functional and production-ready. Recently resolved Prisma migration drift issues that were causing Vercel deployment failures.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `package.json` for standalone project and added missing dependencies.
- Updated `vercel.json` with `version: 2` and removed explicit functions block.
- Updated `api/tsconfig.json` and created root `tsconfig.json` for correct TypeScript compilation.
- Created `public/index.html` for Vercel's public directory requirement and API documentation.
- Updated `.vercelignore` for correct Prisma client handling.
- Fixed `api/lib/prisma.ts` for correct Prisma client import path.
- Updated `api/v1/get-surah-description.ts` to use existing `QuranSurah` model.
- Updated `api/v1/get-metadata.ts` to handle missing `type` query parameter with a default response.
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX: Fixed BigInt serialization errors in all API endpoints**:
  - `get-metadata.ts`: Convert number, ayas, chronologicalOrder, rukus, startIndex, surahNumber, ayahNumber to Numbers
  - `get-verses.ts`: Convert id, sura, aya fields to Numbers
  - `get-translated-verse.ts`: Convert id and index fields to Numbers
- **✅ TESTING: Systematically tested all API endpoints and verified functionality**
- **✅ PRODUCTION: All endpoints now working correctly at https://luminous-verses-api-tan.vercel.app/**
- **✅ COMPREHENSIVE get-translated-verse TESTING**: Tested all parameter combinations, error cases, and verified public accessibility
- **✅ DOCUMENTATION UPDATE**: Updated homepage with correct API URLs and accurate get-translated-verse endpoint specification
- **✅ TRANSLITERATION API**: Implemented comprehensive `/api/v1/get-transliterations` endpoint with 6,236 verses
- **✅ XML DATA PROCESSING**: Fixed malformed XML comments and successfully populated transliteration database
- **✅ MIGRATION DRIFT FIX**: Resolved Prisma migration history mismatch causing Vercel deployment failures
- **✅ PERFORMANCE TESTING**: Achieved excellent performance (10-50ms single verse, 209ms full surah queries)
- **✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Complete test suite with 100% pass rate for transliteration functionality

## Next Steps
- **✅ COMPLETED: All API endpoints including transliterations tested and working correctly**
- Continue to monitor deployment and API performance.
- Explore further enhancements as needed.
- Consider implementing additional features like search functionality or caching strategies.
- Monitor Vercel deployment success after migration drift resolution.
- Consider adding audio recitation endpoints to complement transliterations.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The project is now a standalone API, not a monorepo.
- Vercel's automatic API route detection is being utilized.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Importance of `version: 2` in `vercel.json` for modern Vercel deployments.
- How to handle missing `public` directory in API-only projects on Vercel.
- Correct Prisma client import paths and `.vercelignore` configurations for Vercel.
- Adapting API endpoints to existing data models when a dedicated model is missing.
- Providing user-friendly default responses for API endpoints.
- **CRITICAL: BigInt Serialization Issues** - Prisma BigInt fields cannot be directly serialized to JSON and must be converted to Numbers using `Number()` wrapper in response mapping.
- **API Testing Strategy** - Systematic endpoint testing reveals serialization issues that may not be apparent during development.
- **Production Debugging** - Using curl with jq for API testing provides clear insight into response structure and errors.
- **Deployment Verification** - Always test endpoints after deployment as production environment may behave differently than local development.
- **Prisma Migration Drift** - Database schema and migration history must be perfectly synchronized for successful Vercel deployments.
- **XML Data Processing** - Malformed XML comments can break parsing; proper error handling and data cleaning is essential.
- **Migration Resolution Strategy** - Use `prisma migrate resolve --applied` to mark existing migrations as applied when database already contains the tables.
- **Performance Optimization** - Proper Prisma query optimization with select fields and indexing achieves excellent response times.
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Test suites with performance benchmarks help ensure production readiness and catch regressions.

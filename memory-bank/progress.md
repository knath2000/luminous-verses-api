# Progress

## What Works
- The Quran Data API is successfully deployed on Vercel.
- All API endpoints are functional and respond as expected.
- TypeScript compilation and Prisma client generation are working correctly.
- The `public/index.html` serves as a basic API documentation page.
- CORS headers are correctly configured.
- The `get-surah-description` endpoint now provides information using the `QuranSurah` model.
- The `get-metadata` endpoint provides a default response when no `type` parameter is specified.

## What's Left to Build
- Further enhancements to the API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI integration).
- Implementation of a dedicated `SurahDescription` model if richer descriptions are required in the future.
- Potential performance optimizations and security reviews.

## Current Status
The project is in a stable and deployable state, serving its core purpose as a Quran Data API.

## Known Issues
- None at this time, based on the completed deployment and verification.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Transitioned from a perceived monorepo structure to a standalone API project.
- Adopted Vercel's automatic API route detection for simpler deployment.
- Prioritized immediate deployment fixes while noting areas for future enhancement.

# Progress

## What Works
- The Quran Data API is successfully deployed on Vercel.
- All API endpoints are functional and respond as expected.
- TypeScript compilation and Prisma client generation are working correctly.
- **‚úÖ ENHANCED: Comprehensive developer documentation homepage with modern design and framework examples.**
- **‚úÖ NEW: Interactive features including smooth scrolling navigation and copy-to-clipboard functionality.**
- CORS headers are correctly configured.
- **‚úÖ ENHANCED: The `get-surah-description` endpoint now provides rich, authentic surah descriptions from the Neon database.**
- **‚úÖ NEW: SurahDescription model successfully integrated with existing database schema.**
- **‚úÖ NEW: All 114 surah descriptions populated with scholarly content from JSON data.**
- **‚úÖ FIXED: Data quality issue for Surah 13 resolved with proper Ar-Ra'd description.**
- The `get-metadata` endpoint provides a default response when no `type` parameter is specified.
- User bookmarks functionality working with corrected field names matching database schema.

## What's Left to Build
- Further enhancements to the API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI integration).
- Potential performance optimizations and security reviews.
- Consider adding search functionality for surah descriptions.
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed descriptions.

## Current Status
The project is in a stable and enhanced state, now serving rich, authentic Islamic content through the surah descriptions endpoint AND providing comprehensive developer documentation with framework-specific implementation examples. The API provides both powerful functionality and excellent developer experience.

## Known Issues
- **‚úÖ RESOLVED: BigInt Serialization Errors** - Fixed JSON serialization issues across all API endpoints by converting BigInt fields to Numbers.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Transitioned from a perceived monorepo structure to a standalone API project.
- Adopted Vercel's automatic API route detection for simpler deployment.
- **‚úÖ MAJOR ENHANCEMENT: Successfully integrated existing Neon database surah_descriptions table with Prisma schema.**
- **‚úÖ DATA QUALITY: Implemented data validation and correction during population process.**
- **‚úÖ ARCHITECTURE: Enhanced API response format to include rich metadata and source attribution.**
- **‚úÖ DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE: Created comprehensive documentation homepage with modern framework examples.**
- Prioritized authentic Islamic content over generated descriptions for better user experience.

- **‚úÖ NEW: Framework Coverage**: Added implementation examples for React, Next.js, Vue.js, Angular, Swift iOS, and Flutter
- **‚úÖ NEW: Modern Patterns**: Included current best practices like React hooks with race condition handling, Next.js App Router with Server Components, Vue Composition API, Angular Signals, Swift async/await, and Flutter state management
- **‚úÖ NEW: Interactive Features**: Added smooth scrolling navigation and copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **‚úÖ NEW: Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layout with professional styling
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX: BigInt Serialization**: Resolved JSON serialization errors across all API endpoints by converting BigInt fields to Numbers
- **‚úÖ API TESTING**: Systematically tested all endpoints and verified functionality
- **‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY**: All API endpoints now working correctly in production environment
- **‚úÖ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**: Thoroughly tested get-translated-verse endpoint with all parameter combinations and error cases
- **‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION UPDATE**: Updated homepage documentation with correct API URLs and accurate endpoint specifications

## API Response Format Enhancement
The `get-surah-description` endpoint now returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "source": "neon_database",
  "surah": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": {
      "arabic": "ÿßŸÑŸÅÿßÿ™ÿ≠ÿ©",
      "transliteration": "Al-Fatihah",
      "english": "The Opening"
    },
    "description": "**Surah Al-Fatiha (The Opening)** Often called the \"Mother of the Quran,\" Al-Fatiha is the first Surah...",
    "metadata": {
      "totalVerses": 7,
      "revelationType": "Meccan",
      "chronologicalOrder": 5,
      "rukus": 1,
      "lastUpdated": "2025-05-28T20:39:08.000Z"
    }
  }
}
```

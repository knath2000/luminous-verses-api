# Vercel Deployment Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes and changes implemented to successfully deploy the Quran Data API as a standalone project on Vercel.

## Initial Problem

The project, originally configured as part of a monorepo, faced several deployment issues on Vercel when treated as a standalone API. These issues included:
- Invalid Vercel runtime configuration.
- Mismatched build output paths between TypeScript and Vercel.
- Missing dependencies for specific API functionalities.
- Vercel's requirement for a `public` directory for static assets.
- Prisma client initialization errors due to incorrect import paths and `.vercelignore` configurations.
- API endpoint logic errors (missing `SurahDescription` model, `get-metadata` query parameter handling).

## Implemented Fixes

The following changes were systematically applied to resolve the deployment and functionality issues:

### 1. Project Configuration Updates

-   **`package.json`**:
    -   Changed the project `name` from `@quran-monorepo/quran-data-api` to `quran-data-api` to reflect its standalone nature.
    -   Adjusted the `build` script to `prisma generate && tsc -p api/tsconfig.json` for correct TypeScript compilation.
    -   Added `@clerk/backend` to `dependencies` and `@libsql/client` to `devDependencies` to resolve missing dependency errors.

-   **`vercel.json`**:
    -   Added `"version": 2` to the configuration to ensure Vercel uses the modern schema for deployment.
    -   Removed the explicit `functions` block, allowing Vercel to automatically detect API routes in the `/api` directory.
    -   Updated `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in `headers` to `*` for broader CORS compatibility.
    -   Corrected `rewrites` destination from `/dist/v1/:path*` to `/api/v1/:path*` to align with the new API structure.

-   **`api/tsconfig.json`**:
    -   Modified `outDir` from `dist` to `../dist` to ensure compiled JavaScript files are placed in the root `dist` directory.

-   **`tsconfig.json` (root)**:
    -   Created a new `tsconfig.json` at the root level. This file extends `api/tsconfig.json` and includes `api/**/*.ts` while excluding `node_modules` and `api/test/**/*` to control the build scope.

### 2. Vercel Deployment Specifics

-   **`public/index.html`**:
    -   Created a `public` directory with an `index.html` file inside it. This serves as a basic API documentation page and satisfies Vercel's requirement for a `public` directory, preventing "No Public Directory" errors.

-   **`.vercelignore`**:
    -   Updated the ignore patterns to correctly exclude Prisma WASM and native binaries (`prisma/generated/client/*.wasm`, `prisma/generated/client/libquery_engine-*.node`, etc.) from the Vercel build, preventing conflicts.

### 3. API Endpoint Logic Enhancements

-   **`api/lib/prisma.ts`**:
    -   Corrected the import path for `PrismaClient` from `@prisma/client` to `../../prisma/generated/client` to directly reference the locally generated Prisma client.

-   **`api/v1/get-surah-description.ts`**:
    -   Modified the endpoint to use the existing `QuranSurah` model for retrieving surah information, resolving the error caused by a missing `SurahDescription` model. It now dynamically generates a description based on available `QuranSurah` data.

-   **`api/v1/get-metadata.ts`**:
    -   Enhanced the endpoint to provide a default response when the `type` query parameter is not specified. This makes the endpoint more robust and user-friendly, returning a list of available metadata types and default surah data.

## Outcome

All implemented fixes collectively resolved the deployment issues, allowing the Quran Data API to be successfully deployed and function correctly on Vercel as a standalone project. The API now provides robust functionality, including proper Prisma client initialization, correct build processes, and improved endpoint behavior.
